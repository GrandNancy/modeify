    <p>Hello {{name}},</p>

    <p>During one of our <a href="http://www.commuterpage.com/pages/about/arlington-county-commuter-services/">Arlington County Commuter Services</a> surveys, you offered to assist us with future transportation initiatives. We're writing to ask for your help as we beta test an exciting new resource for commuters in the greater Washington area.</p>

    <p>Arlington County is launching <strong>CarFreeAtoZ</strong>, a new web application created to give travelers a more personalized picture of their transportation options. Part of Arlington's <a href="http://mobilitylab.org/tech/transit-tech-initiative/">Transit Tech Initiative</a>, CarFreeAtoZ aims to go beyond traditional approaches to journey planning, taking a more holistic view of connectivity and accessibility.</p>

    <p>To get started with your personalized commute plan, simply visit <a href="{{link}}">this link</a>.

    <p>You'll be asked a couple quick questions about your travel preferences and your home and work locations. You will then be presented with a series of ranked travel options for that trip, including various combinations of transit, walking, bicycling, and driving.</p>

    <p>CarFreeAtoZ utilizes open transportation data standards such as <a href="http://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/">GTFS</a>, as well as the <a href="http://opentripplanner.org/">OpenTripPlanner</a> multimodal routing engine. The application currently covers walking, biking, and driving in the greater Washington/Baltimore area, as well as the following transit services: ART, DASH, DC Circulator, Fairfax Connector, MTA, PRTC, Ride-On, VRE, and WMATA. Additional transit providers will be added as data becomes available.</p>

    <p>We are very interested to hear what you think about CarFreeAtoZ; any feedback will be used to improve the application before it is launched to a wider audience. If you have comments specific to a particular commute option, please use the built-in feedback link within that option's summary. We also encourage you to complete <a href="{{survey}}">this survey</a> about your overall experience using the site.</p>

    <p>Thank you,</p>

    <p>The CarFreeAtoZ team</p>
