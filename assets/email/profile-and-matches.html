    <p>Hello {{name}},</p>

    <p>During one of our <a href="http://www.commuterpage.com/pages/about/arlington-county-commuter-services/">Arlington County Commuter Services</a> surveys, you offered to assist us with future transportation initiatives. We're writing to ask for your help as we use <strong>CarFreeAtoZ</strong>, an exciting new resource to give travelers a more personalized picture of their transportation options. Part of Arlington's Transit Tech Initiative, <strong>CarfreeAtoZ</strong> aims to go beyond traditional approaches to journey planning, taking a more holistic view of connectivity and accessibility. Use the following link to get started:</p>

    <p>To get started with your personalized commute plan, simply visit <a href="{{link}}">this link</a>.</p>

    <p>You'll be asked a couple quick questions about your travel preferences and your home and work locations. You will then be presented with a series of ranked travel options for that trip, including various combinations of transit, walking, bicycling, and driving.</p>

    <p>CarfreeAtoZ utilizes open transportation data standards such as <a href="http://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/">GTFS</a>, as well as the <a href="http://opentripplanner.org/">OpenTripPlanner</a> multimodal routing engine. The application currently covers walking, biking, and driving in the greater Washington/Baltimore area, as well as the following transit services: ART, DASH, DC Circulator, Fairfax Connector, MTA, PRTC, Ride-On, VRE, and WMATA. Additional transit providers will be added as data becomes available.</p>

    <p>We are very interested to hear what you think about CarfreeAtoZ; any feedback will be used to improve the application. If you have comments specific to a particular travel option, please use the built-in feedback link within that option's summary. We also encourage you to <a href="{{survey}}">complete this survey</a> about your overall experience using the site.</p>

    <p>Thank you,</p>
