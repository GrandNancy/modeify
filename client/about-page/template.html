  <p><strong>CarFreeAtoZ</strong> is an exciting new resource designed to give travelers a more personalized picture of their transportation options. Part of Arlington County's <a href="http://mobilitylab.org/tech/transit-tech-initiative/" target="_blank">Transit Tech Initiative</a>, CarfreeAtoZ aims to go beyond traditional approaches to journey planning, taking a more holistic view of connectivity and accessibility.

  <p>CarFreeAtoZ utilizes open transportation data standards such as <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/" target="_blank">GTFS</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.opentripplanner.org/" target="_blank">OpenTripPlanner</a> multimodal routing engine. The application currently covers walking, biking, and driving in the greater Washington/Baltimore area, as well as the following transit services: ART, DASH, DC Circulator, Fairfax Connector, MTA, PRTC, Ride-On, VRE, and WMATA. Additional transit providers will be added as data becomes available.</p>

  <p><strong>CarFreeAtoZ is currently in beta</strong>, and we are very interested to hear what you think about the application. If you have comments specific to a particular travel option, please use the built-in feedback link within that option's summary. We also encourage you to complete <a href="https://carfreeatoz.typeform.com/to/gbcagR" target="_blank">this survey</a> about your overall experience using the site, and you may send any other feedback to <a href="mailto:feedback@carfreeatoz.com">feedback@carfreeatoz.com</a>.</p>
